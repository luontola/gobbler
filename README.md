Gobbler
======

Gobbler is a build tool for the [Go programming language](http://golang.org/). It allows building and testing multi-package Go projects with one command, without need for manually written Makefiles.

Source code is available at <http://github.com/orfjackal/gobbler>

For discussion, use the [golang-nuts mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts), at least until Gobbler has so many users that it requires its own mailing list. You may also contact Gobbler's developer, [Esko Luontola](http://github.com/orfjackal), by email.
